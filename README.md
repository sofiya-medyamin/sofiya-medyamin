Hi there, 👋 I’m Sofiya!🙆‍♀️💫

## About me 👀 
I'm someone who started my journey with a passion for UI/UX design, enjoying the creative process of building intuitive and user-friendly experiences. During my final year of study, I developed a growing interest in data analytics and data science, where I find the challenging and complex process that it entails exciting. 😮✨  

I’m currently expanding my knowledge and brushing my skills in: 
- 🌱 Data Wrangling & Preprocessing
- 🍄 Data Visualization, Data exploration
- 🌷 Data Modelling & Machine Learning

P.S. I'm working on a ML project for fraud detection at the moment, i will be sharing it on GitHub right after it's ready! ₍^. .^₎⟆
